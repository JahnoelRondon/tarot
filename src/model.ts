    The Trumps cards (also known as Major Arcana) signify "above all". The Major Arcana cards are not like the
     Minorsâ€”while the Minors can be pretty specific (focusing on actual situations, feelings, etcetera), the 
     Majors are more about energy fields and influences. They may reflect a spiritual search, attainment or 
     life lesson. Sometimes they reflect forces beyond our control. They warn us that resistance is futile, and 
     that we need to adjust our perception or increase understanding and acceptance.
